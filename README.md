Places to Stay Web App

- initially preparing for this to be an app similar to Waze after going through the lectures and waiting for the Assessment Brief

In this scenario I have been tasked with developing a web app from scratch named "Places to Stay" which is an online booking system for inns, motels and other lodging facilities. I am required to use node JS and express as my back-end tech, chosen MySQL for database management, AJAX, Bootstrap and JQuery for frontend development.

Hope you enjoy!
